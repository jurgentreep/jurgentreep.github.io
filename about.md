Hello, my name is Jurgen Treep and I love to build cutting edge websites. I work with technologies like; Node.js, MongoDB, Express, Laravel 5, Eloquent, Sass and sometimes I don't use these technologies at all and just use plain PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

If you want to see more I suggest you check out my Github.
