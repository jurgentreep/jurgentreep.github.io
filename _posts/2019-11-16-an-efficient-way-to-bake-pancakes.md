title: "An efficient way to bake pancakes"

I can't help but try to do things as efficiently as possible. I'm not quite sure why but I guess to keep myself from being bored I try to change the way I bake pancakes every now and then. The changes I make are not big and I think most people wouldn't even notice them. That being said I think that through the years I've found a pretty efficient way to bake pancakes.

First I'll show you the recipe and after that I'll describe how I make the process efficient.

Ingredients:
* 2 eggs
* 250 grams of flour
* 500 ml of milk
* pinch of salt (optional)
* Sunflower oil

Cookware:
* Bowl
* Wisk
* Pan
* Scale
* Ladle

Preparation:
1. Put 2 eggs into a bowl and add a pinch of salt if you like.
2. Wisk the eggs
3. Add 250 grams of flour
4. Add 200 ml of milk
5. Wisk till you've got a smooth batter
6. Add 300 ml of milk
7. Wisk till the rest of the milk is dissolved into the batter
8. Heat a pan on the stove
9. Put a drop of sunflower oil in the pan
10. Turn the pan to spread the oil
11. Use the ladle to pour the batter into the pan
12. Rotate the pan slowly while you pour the batter
13. Let the pancake sit till the top is dry
14. Flip the pancake
15. Put the pancake on a plate

The best way to wisk I've found is by making a quick motion from right to left and only occasionally making a circle.

I think the biggest time saver is to use one of those scales where you can put the bowl right on top and then reset it to 0. After you've wisked the eggs you can just leave the wisk in the bowl and put it on the scale. After that you reset the weight back to 0 and add your 250 grams of flour and the repeat same steps to add your 200 ml (about the same as 200 grams) of milk. When you've added all the ingredients you can wisk everything into a nice smooth batter and add the last 300 ml of milk.

I used to measure the flour and milk separately which caused me to have more dishes than necessary and it took more time because I had to put the milk and flour into separate containers.

You might ask yourself why I wouldn't just add the 500 ml of milk in one go, after all this would reduce the amount of steps required. The reason I don't do this is because this will cause the batter to have lumps in it which are really hard to get rid off assuming this is even possible.

I hope you enjoyed my thoughts on pancakes and have found some useful tips to make the way you cook your pancakes more efficient.
