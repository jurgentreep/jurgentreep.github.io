Hi there! This is my first blog post. I'll try to write a little bit about myself and the things I'm interested in.

Let's start with a little bit about myself. My name is Jurgen. I'm currently 24 years old and I work as a web developer for a small company called [7Lab](https://7lab.nl). In my free time I like to solve escape rooms with my friends, play games on the couch with them, read a book, listen to music or go for a run.

I'm social but I really like my alone time too. A whole day of talking with other people can be really tiring for me.

With this blog I hope to write my thoughts down and maybe write some tutorials about web development or other technical problems. I'm thinking about writing a post on how to set up github pages on a windows machine because the tutorial didn't work for me out of the box.
